# Fury-Angular-Client-With-ABP

## Introduction to Fury
Fury is a creative material design admin template built with Angular 6 and the Angular-CLI. It extends the Material Design components built by the Angular 2 team and it offers you everything you need to get started with your next CRM, CMS or dashboard based project.

AngularJS2 / Angular 2 / Angular 6 is the perfect framework for building large enterprise applications and allows for a modular component setup. Components can be added and removed by simply removing the corresponding folder, as everything added is always component-specific and modular.

We built Fury to be as much and as easy as possible to customize. Navigation Menu Items can be added dynamically from anywhere, Breadcrumbs are auto-generated, but can also be assigned a custom name and new pages can easily be added by just generating a component with the awesome Angular-CLI. Adding to this we use Flex-Layout by the Angular team to provide a flexible and fast way for layouts.

## Introduction to ABP
ASP.NET Boilerplate (ABP) is an open source and well-documented application framework. It's not just a framework, it also provides a strong architectural model based on Domain Driven Design, with all the best practices in mind.

ABP works with the latest ASP.NET Core & EF Core but also supports ASP.NET MVC 5.x & EF 6.x as well.
